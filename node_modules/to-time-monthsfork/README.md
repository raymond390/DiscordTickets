# to-time [FORK]

***DISCLAIMER***
> This is a forked version of the repository to help with the development of another project.
> Month units are added, however they are not accurate. Instead they are the mean length of the month according to the Gregorian Calendar, which is `30.436875` days.

Utility for converting textual time periods to time units (milliseconds, seconds, minutes, hours, etc..).

This is not intended to be as accurate as the official [to-time](https://www.npmjs.com/package/to-time) package is, as this is for generic use cases. Use the official branch if that is what you are after.
